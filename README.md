Clash and Retroclash
====================

This repo is just a playground for experimenting with the functional
hardware description language [Clash] and the programs and ideas in the
book [_Retrocomputing with Clash: Haskell for FPGA Hardware Design_][retro].
Some programs here are versions of the example programs in the book, also
available in the [`gergoerdi/retroclash-book-code`][book-code] repo on
GitHub.

Do not expect the code in this repo to work or do anything useful.

Handy notes:
- `Test` builds and (soon) runs a few tests
- `i` runs the interpreter; pass in filenames to load on the command line
